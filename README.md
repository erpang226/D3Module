# D3Module

```text
The purpose of this project is to create a modular framework based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, named D3Module, that aims to enhance the organization, structure, and maintainability of codebase related to specific business domains. By utilizing Golang as the development language, D3Module enables the plug-in management of different modules within a single process, supporting startup, shutdown, and hot-swapping of components. This approach facilitates flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, enabling developers to focus on building robust and scalable business applications.
